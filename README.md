# LoveHange
Here's the thing:
I am a member of the audio-visual education committee. In principle, other students can't touch the audio-visual equipment of our class without my permission, but! Yes!
There is a big boss in our class, called Brother Han. The old gentleman didn't listen to my greeting. Originally, physical education class rushed to the classroom to play some cartoons and calligraphy when he was free to move (because I like playing ball games downstairs and so on, it has an opportunity). Because of his impatience, I, in line with the concept of "putting harmony first", would fight back my anger and persuade him to turn it off every time I came upstairs.
However, it may be because it thinks I am easy to talk to and lax in management. Now it has gradually developed into a longer class break, ignoring my existence directly and starting to play videos.
It's just time to take the junior high school exam. It's useless to say more. Let him feel the charm of information technology.

Go!

# Supplement
I'm really a little funny, but it's actually a gadget that forcibly terminates the process. I've been working on it for so long.
I'll shift the focus to Edu-Manager, which will integrate the current LoveHange.

事情是这样的：
我是电教委员，原则上来说，没有我的允许，其他同学是不能动我们班的电教设备的，但！是！
我们班有一位大佬，叫它涵哥，老先生不听我招呼，原本只是体育课趁自由活动的时候冲上教室来放点什么动漫，手书之类的（因为我喜欢在楼下打打球之类的，它就有了可乘之机），由于此人的性子比较急躁，我本着“以和为贵”的观念，每次我上楼来都会强忍着怒火劝他自己关掉。
可是可能因为它认为我比较好说话，管的不严，它现在已经逐渐发展到长一点的课间，直接无视我的存在就开始放视频。
正好要考小三科了，多说无益，让他感受下信息技术的魅力。

走你！

# 补充
我真的是有那么一点点好笑，其实就是一个强制终止进程的小玩意我居然搞了那么久🤣
重心转移至Edu-Manager, 这个项目会集成现在的LoveHange.
